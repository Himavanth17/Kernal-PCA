1. Import necessary libraries:
    
    ```python
    
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    ```
    
    - `pandas` is used for handling the data.
    - `matplotlib.pyplot` is for plotting graphs (though it's not used in this snippet).
    - `numpy` is for numerical operations.
2. Load the data:
    
    ```python
    
    df = pd.read_csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')
    
    ```
    
    - This line reads the CSV file named 'Social_Network_Ads.csv' into a DataFrame called `df`.
3. Separate features and labels:
    
    ```python
    
    x = df.iloc[:,:-1].values
    y = df.iloc[:,-1].values
    
    ```
    
    - `x` is created by taking all rows and all columns except the last one. This contains the input features.
    - `y` is created by taking all rows and only the last column. This contains the labels (the target output).
4. Split the data into training and testing sets:
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(x,y,test_size=0.25,random_state=0)
    
    ```
    
    - The data is split into training and testing sets. 75% of the data is used for training (`x_train`, `y_train`) and 25% for testing (`x_test`, `y_test`).
    - `random_state=0` ensures the split is the same every time you run the code.
5. Scale the features:
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    sc = StandardScaler()
    x_train = sc.fit_transform(x_train)
    x_test = sc.transform(x_test)
    
    ```
    
    - Feature scaling ensures that all the input features have the same scale.
    - `fit_transform` calculates the mean and standard deviation from the training data and scales it.
    - `transform` scales the test data using the same mean and standard deviation as the training data.
6. Train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with RBF kernel:
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn import svm
    classifier = svm.SVC(kernel = 'rbf',random_state = 0)
    classifier.fit(x_train,y_train)
    
    ```
    
    - `svm.SVC` is used to create a Support Vector Classifier.
    - `kernel='rbf'` specifies that we want to use the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, which is good for non-linear data.
    - `random_state=0` ensures reproducibility.
    - The model is trained (or "fit") using the training data (`x_train`, `y_train`).
7. Make predictions on the test set:
    
    ```python
    
    y_pred = classifier.predict(x_test)
    
    ```
    
    - The model makes predictions on the test data (`x_test`), and the predicted labels are stored in `y_pred`.
8. Compare predictions with actual labels:
    
    ```python
    
    print(np.concatenate((y_pred.reshape(len(y_pred),1), y_test.reshape(len(y_test),1)),1))
    
    ```
    
    - The predicted labels (`y_pred`) and the actual labels (`y_test`) are reshaped into column vectors.
    - These column vectors are concatenated horizontally so that each row shows the predicted label and the actual label side by side.
    - The result is printed out, allowing you to compare the predicted labels with the actual labels.
9. Evaluate the model using a confusion matrix and accuracy score:
    
    ```python
    pythonCopy code
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,accuracy_score
    cm  = confusion_matrix(y_test,y_pred)
    print(cm)
    accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred)
    
    ```
    
    - `confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)` creates a confusion matrix to summarize the performance of the classification model.
    - `print(cm)` prints the confusion matrix.
    - `accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)` calculates the accuracy of the model, which is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.
